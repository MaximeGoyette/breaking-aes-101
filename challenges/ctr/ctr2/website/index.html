        <h1>AES-CTR 2!</h1>
        You listened on the cable a bit and were able to capture the following ciphertexts:
        <div id="secret_ciphertext"></div>
        It has been encrypted with AES256-CTR with the code in ctr2.py. You can check the code!<br>
        Break the first one, and send the flag here:<br>
        <input id="flag_input"><br>
        <button id="btn_verify">Verify</button><br>
        <div id="verify_box"></div>
        Note that due to the random nature of flag generation, the challenge MIGHT be impossible, but that's a rare occurence. Just re-run the server if it does.<br>
